# Deep-Learning-project-on-image-classification
Project to explore transfer learning for image classification (binary classifier) using medical images, to compare the performance of self-built and pre-trained models with and w/o data augmentation, with all layers frozen and some layers trainable, with higher and lower learning rates, with 2 different optimizers: RMSprop and Adam.
